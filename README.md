# react-study-lab
Created with CodeSandbox
# A lab space for React Study (19.2)

I would like to study the document of react at https://react.dev/learn
therefore this repo is created for the code of chaters.
I was not meant to make it a github repo
so I started with codesandbox
however the vscode env has become quite slow as the code base grew
so it is moved to here now.

let us enjoy the journey and have fun
